# ECSE 321 Project - Group 19

## Project Description

We are designing a multi-tier software solution to allow students to easily find tutors for specific courses that they are struggling with. This tutoring application system will be in the form of an Android application and a website. This application system will allow students to choose from a variety of tutors and they will be able to see their availability, their hourly rate, as well as reviews. Students will be able to reserve a spot with the tutor of their choice provided the availability of the tutor and room.

This project is being done in sprints using the Agile Development Process. This means that we are meeting, planning, designing, developing, testing, and evaluating our application system at each iteration of our project. Our tutoring application is being designed by 5 team members, each having a specific task for each deliverable. In designing this application, we are following the proper convention of writing up methods and then creating the tests to pass our necessary requirements.
